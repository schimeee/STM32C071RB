# STM32 Educational Examples — Project Template Overview

> **Purpose:** This repository provides a **minimal educational structure** for STM32 example projects. It includes selected source files (such as `main.c`, `vcp.c`, or GPIO examples) and guides you through creating the remaining project components. The goal is to help learners understand the structure of STM32 projects and learn how to assemble them manually.

## Repository structure

```
GPIO_baremetal/
└─ Core/
   └─ Src/
      └─ main.c     <- Example main program file for GPIO

GPIO_HAL/
└─ Core/
   └─ Src/
      └─ main.c     <- Example main program file for GPIO

VirtComPort_Example/
└─ Core/
   └─ Src/
      ├─ main.c     <- Example main program file
      └─ vcp.c      <- Example module (e.g., Virtual COM Port)
```

> **Note:** This repository includes **only minimal source files** for educational inspection. It does not contain the HAL library, CMSIS files, startup code, or linker scripts. You will create or import those components as part of your learning process.

## Project overview

STM32 projects are typically structured in a standardized way when generated by STM32CubeIDE or STM32CubeMX. The essential folders and their purpose are:

```
ProjectName/
├─ Core/
│  ├─ Inc/        <- Header files (user includes)
│  └─ Src/        <- Source files (main.c, user modules)
│
├─ Drivers/
│  ├─ CMSIS/      <- Cortex-M core support
│  └─ STM32xx_HAL_Driver/ <- HAL peripheral drivers
│
├─ Middlewares/   <- Optional middleware (e.g., USB, FreeRTOS)
├─ Startup/       <- MCU startup assembly file
└─ LinkerScript/  <- Linker script (defines memory layout)
```

## How to create the rest of the project

### 1. Generate a base project

Use **STM32CubeIDE** or **STM32CubeMX** to generate a new project for your MCU:

1. Open STM32CubeIDE.
2. Create a **New STM32 Project**.
3. Select your target MCU or board (e.g., *STM32C071RBTx*).
4. Choose to initialize all peripherals to their default mode.
5. Click **Finish** to generate the base project.

This will automatically create the `Core/`, `Drivers/`, and other folders.

---

### 2. Integrate the educational example files

After generating the project:

1. Copy the example source files into the appropriate directory:

   * For VirtComPort → `VirtComPort_Example/Core/Src/main.c` and `vcp.c`
   * For GPIO → `GPIO_Example/Core/Src/main.c` and `gpio_app.c`
2. Add the corresponding header files in `Core/Inc/`:

   * `vcp.h`, `gpio_app.h`, etc. (create them if missing)
3. Verify include paths:

   * Open project properties → **C/C++ General → Paths and Symbols** → ensure `Core/Inc` and `Drivers` are listed.

---

### 3. Add missing startup and linker files (if needed)

If you are not using CubeIDE, you need:

* `startup_stm32xxxx.s` → the startup assembly file for your MCU.
* Linker script (e.g., `STM32C071RBTX_FLASH.ld`) → defines Flash and RAM regions.

You can obtain these from an existing STM32Cube example or generate them through CubeMX.

---

### 4. Add the HAL and CMSIS libraries

1. Copy the `Drivers/CMSIS` and `Drivers/STM32xx_HAL_Driver` directories from an official STM32Cube package.
2. Include these paths in your project’s build configuration.

For USB or other middleware examples, also include:

* `Middlewares/ST/STM32_USB_Device_Library/`

---

### 5. Build and flash

Once the missing components are in place:

1. Build the project using STM32CubeIDE or the command line with `arm-none-eabi-gcc`.
2. Flash your MCU using ST-Link, CubeProgrammer, or any compatible tool.

---

## Educational objectives

* Learn how STM32 project structures are organized.
* Understand the role of each project component (HAL, CMSIS, middleware, startup, linker script).
* Practice assembling a project manually to gain deeper insight into embedded development.
